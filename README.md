# Password Generator Starter Code

# Purpose

A website that generates different passwords of your choice. You can change the options to how ever you like where it will give you password choices in lowercase, upppercase, special characters, and numeric.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Challenges

- I'm unable to display the password onto the website. At first I was getting somewhere because the Generation password was working, but now it's not. I don't know what I am overlooking. This definitely has been my biggest challenge so far.

* I'm also having issues where my ReadMe is the website of the application. Need help getting this fix.
